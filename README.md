## Introduction

The WeatherStation project aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use solution for building a personal weather station using ESP32 microcontroller. The project supports BME280 sensor to measure temperature, humidity, pressure.

## Features

- Measure temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- Easy to set up and configure.
- Real-time data monitoring.
- Modular and extensible design.

## Projects

Each folder in this repository is an individual ESP-IDF project:

- SensorStation: Contains the code for the sensor integration.
- Server: Contains the server code for data collection and processing.
- TerminalApp: Contains the terminal application code for interacting with the weather station.

## Hardware 

- Microcontroller ESP32
- Sensor BME280
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply (e.g., USB cable, batteries)
